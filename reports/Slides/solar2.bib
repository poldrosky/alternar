	abstract = {Cloud detection and tracking ({CDT}) is the most challenging problem in integrating solar energy into the smart grid. In this paper, we present a novel 3D cloud detection and tracking using images from three {TSI} (Total Sky Imager), and propose to incorporate history into a multi-layer cloud detection pipeline. Our pilot study shows that the new {CDT} significantly improves the short-term solar irradiance forecasting and enable regional radiation prediction, which is impossible with a single {TSI}.},
