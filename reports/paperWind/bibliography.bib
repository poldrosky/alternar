A first application of the model was conducted at a study area with an extensive windbreak network in England (Thetford, East Anglia). Windbreak characteristics (windbreak type, height, width, porosity, and location) were recorded. Porosity was estimated from digitized {B/W} silhouettes. To evaluate the network effectiveness, a windbreak network shelter index ({SI)} was proposed in terms of average reduction of friction velocity over the area due to network shelter. The network was found to give good protection, but the windbreak distribution was not optimal in relation to the wind vector distribution.},

	abstract = {The development of new wind energy projects requires a significant consideration of land use issues. An analytic framework using a Geographic Information System ({GIS)} was developed to evaluate site suitability for wind turbines and to predict the locations and extent of land available for feasible wind power development. The framework uses rule-based spatial analysis to evaluate different scenarios. The suitability criteria include physical requirements as well as environmental and human impact factors. By including socio-political concerns, this technique can assist in forecasting the acceptance level of wind farms by the public. The analysis was used to evaluate the nine-county region of the Greater San Francisco Bay Area. The model accurately depicts areas where large-scale wind farms have been developed or proposed. It also shows that there are many locations available in the Bay Area for the placement of smaller-scale wind turbines. The framework has application to other regions where future wind farm development is proposed. This information can be used by energy planners to predict the extent that wind energy can be developed based on land availability and public perception.},

	abstract = {Because of the current shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy sources, it is necessary to plan for the installation of new infrastructure to meet the demand for clean energy. Traditional methods for determining wind turbine site suitability suffer from the selection of arbitrary criteria and model parameters by experts, which may lead to a degree of uncertainty in the models produced. An alternative empirically based methodology for building a wind turbine siting model for the state of Iowa is presented in the study. We employ {\textquoteleft}ecological niche{\textquoteright} principles traditionally utilized to model species allocation to develop a new multicriteria, spatially explicit framework for wind turbine placement. Using information on suitability conditions at existing turbine locations, we incorporate seven variables (wind speed, elevation, slope, land cover, distance of infrastructure and settlements, and population density) into two machine-learning algorithms [maximum entropy method (Maxent) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule Set Prediction ({GARP)]} to model suitable areas for installation of wind turbines. The performance of this method is tested at the statewide level and a six-county region in western Iowa. Maxent and {GARP} identified areas in the Northwest and North Central regions of Iowa as the optimum location for new wind turbines. Information on variable contributions from Maxent illuminates the relative importance of environmental variables and its scale-dependent nature. It also allows validating existing assumptions about the relationship between variables and wind turbine suitability. The resultant models demonstrate high levels of accuracy and suggest that the presented approach is a possible methodology for developing wind turbine siting applications.

	abstract = {Given a collection of boolean spatial features, the co-location pattern discovery process finds the subsets of features frequently located together. For example, the analysis of an ecology dataset may reveal the frequent co-location of a fire ignition source feature with a needle vegetation type feature and a drought feature. The spatial co-location rule problem is different from the association rule problem. Even though boolean spatial feature types (also called spatial events) may correspond to items in association rules over market-basket datasets, there is no natural notion of transactions. This creates difficulty in using traditional measures (e.g. support, confidence) and applying association rule mining algorithms which use support based pruning. We propose a notion of user-specified neighborhoods in place of transactions to specify groups of items. New interest measures for spatial co-location patterns are proposed which are robust in the face of potentially infinite overlapping neighborhoods. We also propose an algorithm to mine frequent spatial co-location patterns and analyze its correctness, and completeness. We plan to carry out experimental evaluations and performance tuning in the near future.},

	abstract = {A co-location pattern is a group of spatial features/events that are frequently co-located in the same region. For example, human cases of West Nile Virus often occur in regions with poor mosquito control and the presence of birds. For co-location pattern mining, previous studies often emphasize the equal participation of every spatial feature. As a result, interesting patterns involving events with substantially different frequency cannot be captured. In this paper, we address the problem of mining co-location patterns with rare spatial features. Specifically, we first propose a new measure called the maximal participation ratio ({maxPR)} and show that a co-location pattern with a relatively high {maxPR} value corresponds to a co-location pattern containing rare spatial events. Furthermore, we identify a weak monotonicity property of the {maxPR} measure. This property can help to develop an efficient algorithm to mine patterns with high {maxPR} values. As demonstrated by our experiments, our approach is effective in identifying co-location patterns with rare events, and is efficient and scalable for large-scale data sets.},

	abstract = {Wind is a dynamic geographic phenomenon that is often characterized by its speed and by the direction from which it blows. The cycle{\textquoteright}s effect of heating and cooling on the Earth{\textquoteright}s surface causes the wind speed and direction to change throughout the day. Understanding the changeability of wind speed and direction simultaneously in long term time series of wind measurements is a challenging task. Discovering such pattern highlights the recurring of speed together with direction that can be extracted in specific chronological order of time. In this chapter, we present a novel way to explore wind speed and direction simultaneously using sequential pattern mining approach for detecting frequent patterns in spatio-temporal wind datasets. The Linear time Closed pattern Miner sequence ({LCMseq}) algorithm is constructed to search for significant sequential patterns of wind speed and direction simultaneously. Then, the extracted patterns were explored using visual representation called {TileVis} and 3D wind rose in order to reveal any valuable trends in the occurrences patterns. The applied methods demonstrated an improvement way of understanding of temporal characteristics of wind resources.},
